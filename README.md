deck_of_cards
=============

Python module that models a deck of cards using OO Design

The size of the deck was not specified, so I built one that can represent
different kinds of card decks, including French deck, Pinochle and Euchre.

Card is a small object holding the rank and suit.
Deck is a list of Card objects. In a card game, there could be multiple
 Deck objects to represent player's hands, discard pile, played tricks.
